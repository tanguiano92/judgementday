  <center><h1>Judgement Day: Artist Statement</h1></center>
  <center><p>One of my earliest memories of my introduction of Catholicism was of my Abuela's church priest<br>
  explaining to her and I about how children are born inherently as sinners and it is up to<br>
him and the adults in our lives to keep us on the right path in life so we can someday make<br>
it to heaven when we die. I remember being puzzled by this statement as I was only seven-years<br>
-old and as far as I knew, I was not a bad child. I was taught a year later that my being a girl<br>
child meant my soul was even in more danger of falling victim to evil forces than that of boys my<br>
age. If I wanted to go to heaven one day, I could not want for false idols, I had to stay pure in body,<br>
mind and spirit until marriage, I had to follow my father's rules until I was passed on to a husband<br>
and I had to do my duty of being a stay-at-home mother who blindly followed whatever demands my future<br>
husband would have for me when the time came. I was eight when I began to question those rules and statements.<br>
They didn't make sense to me. I knew I was being groomed by an adult male priest and my father's family to be<br>
afraid of myself and learn that I could not be trusted with my freedom, choices, and life. When I was thirteen<br>
I decided for myself to stray away from the toxic brand of Catholicism that had been fed to me as a child.<br>
I became a witch. I converted into pagainsim and when my Catholic family found out, I was kicked out of my<br>
family home until I repented and go back to church. However, after weeks of refusing to return to Catholicism, <br>
and as a last ditch attempt to reel me back in, my family called me up and asked me to talk to their parish priest<br>
about my decision. In which I refused. Later on in life, I found out that my family were going to have an exorcism<br>
conducted on me because my family was terrified that my leaving the religion would mean I would not go to heaven<br>
with them when we are all gone. I eventually went back home and my father had no choice but accept my new beliefs<br>
but I often think about what would have happened if I agreed to go with my family to the church that day so long ago.<br>
How far would they have taken the encounter? What would I have been put through? All because they were afraid of<br>
my judgement day. They thought they were going to save me from myself and damnation. I never considered my free<br>
will would be a threat. Once I unlearned what had been forced onto me as a child and I no longer wonder about whether<br>
or not I will go to heaven or hell after I die, I wonder now where I will go? I understand that my experience does<br>
not speak for everyone's experience with this religion, however I began poking holes and questioning the things that<br>
were said to me by adults at church. I created "Judgement Day" as a therapy piece for myself and also to follow<br>
my theme of the afterlife. The aspect of there being a crossroads and depending on which path you choose will<br>
determine whether you go to heaven or hell. To me, the path to heaven was boring and I was never going to walk<br>
down that trail. I don't believe in hell or heaven anymore but if I had to choose which way to go, well, I will<br>
embrace my sinner soul if it means I can live for myself and not be prepped to only be a mother and wife.</p></center>
